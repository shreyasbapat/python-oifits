Getting started
===============

Overview
--------

The problem of understanding the open data that is provided by Event Horizon
Telescope team on VLBI Reconstruction Portal (http://vlbiimaging.csail.mit.edu)
is complicated. All the radio interferometry data is generally stored in OIFITS
file rather than a normal FITS file. There is a lot of Radio Astronomy specific
data that has to be taken out and understood before working on the acquired data
and analysing it. OIFITS is a standard for exchanging data for Optical (Visible/IR)
Interferometry, and is based on the FITS Standard. Since mm/sub-mm VLBI shares a
lot of similarities to optical interferometry, this format is better suited for
mm/sub-mm measurements than UVFITS.

``oifits`` is a Python package for reading and analysing OIFITS Data. One can easily
procure the interferometry data from the oifits file and store every thing in a numpy
array for further analysis.
``oifits`` also relies heavily on and interfaces well with the implementations of
 fits module of ``Astropy`` package [@astropy] (``astropy.io.fits``).

``oifits`` is designed to be used by both researchers working on Optical Interferometry
and by researchers working on Event Horizon Telescope Data.

Installation
------------

Itâ€™s as easy as running one command!
